# Advent of Code

To initialize the workspace, launch the CLI `advent.bat` or `advent`

The CLI will display a menu
```
Selected year: 2020
1. Change year (2020)
2. Create new year workspace for 2020
3. Update inputs from AdventOfCode website for 2020
q. Exit
```

Use the corresponding letter to select an option in the menu.

> The CLI will never override the source, you can use the option 2, if any source file already exists, the CLI will leave this file untouched.
